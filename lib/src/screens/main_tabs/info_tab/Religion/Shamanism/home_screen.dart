It originated among the Turkic and Mongolic-speaking peoples, including the Mongols, Turks, and Tuvans. The term "Tengrism" comes from the word "Tengri," which means "sky" or "heaven" in the Turkic and Mongolic languages.Tengrism is based on the worship of Tengri, the supreme sky god or deity, who is believed to govern all aspects of the natural world, including celestial bodies, weather phenomena, and the well-being of humans and animals. Tengri is often depicted as a benevolent and all-powerful being, and followers of Tengrism believe in maintaining a harmonious relationship with the natural world and the spirits that reside within it.In Tengrism, nature is considered sacred, and various natural elements, such as mountains, rivers, trees, and animals, are revered and believed to possess spiritual qualities. Ancestor worship is also an important aspect of Tengrism, with ancestors being venerated and believed to provide guidance and protection to their living descendants.',

They act as intermediaries between the human world and the spiritual realm, performing rituals, conducting ceremonies, and communicating with spirits and deities. Shamans are believed to have the ability to heal the sick, predict the future, and maintain harmony with the spiritual forces.Tengrism was widespread among the nomadic peoples of Central Asia, including the Mongols, during the height of the Mongol Empire in the 13th and 14th centuries. However, with the rise of Genghis Khan and the subsequent expansion of the Mongol Empire, a policy of religious tolerance was adopted, allowing the coexistence of various religious beliefs, including Tengrism, Buddhism, and Islam.With the gradual conversion of the Mongols to other religions, particularly Buddhism and later Islam, Tengrism declined in popularity and influence. Today, there is a renewed interest in Tengrism among Mongolians some Central Asian communities, particularly among the Turkic peoples of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, who are exploring and reviving their pre-Islamic cultural and spiritual heritage.Tengrism is considered an important part of the cultural and historical identity of Central Asian peoples, and efforts are being made to preserve and revive its traditions, rituals, and beliefs. It is worth noting that Tengrism does not have a centralized religious institution or organized doctrine but rather encompasses a diverse range of beliefs and practices across different regions and communities.',
