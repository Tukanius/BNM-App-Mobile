The socialist era (1924-1990) greatly influenced Mongolian art, with the government promoting socialist realism as the dominant artistic style. Artists were encouraged to depict the achievements of socialism, the beauty of the Mongolian landscape, and the valor of its people, often in an idealized manner.
