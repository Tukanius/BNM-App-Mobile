                    'Mongolian wrestling, known as Bokh in Mongolian, is the national sport of Mongolia and has a long history dating back centuries. It is a traditional form of wrestling that holds significant cultural and historical importance in Mongolian society. Bokh is deeply rooted in the nomadic lifestyle and warrior traditions of the Mongolian people. Competitors wear special traditional clothing called "zodog," which consists of tight-fitting, sleeveless jackets made from silk or satin, and shorts called "shuudag." Wrestlers do not wear shirts underneath the zodog to ensure a firm grip for their opponents. The objective of Mongolian wrestling is to force the opponent to touch the ground with any part of their body other than their feet or hands. There are no weight classes in Bökh, and the matches are typically one-on-one. A wrestler is declared the winner when they successfully make their opponent touch the ground. Mongolian wrestling is a prominent feature during the Naadam festival, which is the largest and most important traditional festival in Mongolia. Naadam takes place annually during the summer and features not only wrestling but also horse racing, archery, and other cultural events. Wrestlers undergo rigorous training and conditioning to develop their strength, agility, and technique. They often begin training from a young age and are mentored by experienced wrestlers. Training includes both physical preparation and the learning of various wrestling techniques and strategies. Bokh is more than just a sport; it holds deep cultural significance. It is considered a display of strength, sportsmanship, and the embodiment of Mongolian values, such as bravery, honor, and respect for tradition. Mongolian wrestling emphasizes respect for elders and traditions. Younger wrestlers show great respect to their senior counterparts and are expected to greet them in a traditional manner before and after matches.',
