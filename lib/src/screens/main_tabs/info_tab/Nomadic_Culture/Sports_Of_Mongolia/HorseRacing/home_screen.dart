What makes Mongolian horse racing unique is that the jockeys are typically children, often as young as five years old.

Mongolian horse racing places importance on selecting strong and swift horses for the races. Horses with good endurance and stamina are favored, as they need to cover long distances at a considerable pace. Horse racing in Mongolia is not only a sport but also a community event. Local communities gather to watch and cheer for the young jockeys, creating a festive and lively atmosphere during the races. Horse racing is deeply connected to the traditional nomadic lifestyle of the Mongolian people. Horses have been a vital part of their culture, serving as transportation, companions, and symbols of freedom and independence. While horse racing has always been a cherished tradition, it has also gained popularity beyond the Naadam festival. Horse racing events and competitions are organized throughout the year, attracting both locals and tourists. Mongolian horse racing highlights the country is strong connection to its nomadic past and its appreciation for horses, which have played a crucial role in Mongolian culture and history.
